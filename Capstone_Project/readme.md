# Dynamic Parking Pricing Using Real-Time Demand Modeling

## üåç Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Bharatiya Antariksh Hackathon 2025**, under Problem Statement 3: *"Monitoring Air Pollution from Space using Satellite Observations, Ground-Based Measurements, Reanalysis Data, and AI/ML Techniques"*. However, this module specifically focuses on **Model 2** of dynamic parking pricing using ground-based observational data, such as parking occupancy, vehicle type, queue length, and traffic levels.

We implemented a real-time pricing algorithm that adjusts the daily parking price based on calculated demand using various influencing factors. The model mimics nonlinear market behavior and applies bounded pricing between a minimum and maximum threshold.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Architecture & Workflow

### 1. **Data Ingestion**

- The raw data containing fields like `Timestamp`, `Occupancy`, `Capacity`, `QueueLength`, `VehicleType`, `IsSpecialDay`, and `TrafficConditionNearby` is streamed into the system using `pw.demo.replay_csv()` from Pathway.

### 2. **Time Conversion & Partitioning**

- The timestamp string is converted into datetime format.
- A daily key (`day_str`) is extracted for windowing purposes.

### 3. **Temporal Windowing**

- Using Pathway's `.windowby(...)`, the data is grouped by day into fixed 1-day tumbling windows.
- This allows us to compute daily summaries of metrics like occupancy, traffic, and queue length.

### 4. **Demand Modeling**

- A nonlinear demand function is calculated based on:
  - Occupancy range (occ\_max - occ\_min)
  - Occupancy spike factor (occ\_max / occ\_min)
  - QueueLength (normalized)
  - VehicleType (treated as ordinal, normalized)
  - TrafficConditionNearby (centered at zero)
  - IsSpecialDay (alters weights and curve shape)

### 5. **Price Generation**

- Demand is passed into a linear multiplier to get an `unbounded_price`.
- This value is clipped between ‚Çπ5 and ‚Çπ20 using `apply_with_type()`.

### 6. **Visualization**

- The final prices are visualized in a time-series line chart using **Bokeh** and **Panel**.
- Each dot represents a day; the line captures pricing trends.
